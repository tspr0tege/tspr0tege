## üöÄ Projects

### [Project Catwalk](https://github.com/tspr0tege/Project-Catwalk)

This was the Frontend Capstone project my team did in Hack Reactor. The premise was to design a product page for a fashion website. I was responsible for the main product ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù section. The API was maintained by the school, and is no longer available, so unfortunately the site cannot be demoed. During the program, we built it using a Node/express server and consuming the provided API. For presentation I personally deployed it to an AWS EC2 instance.

### [Codewars Solutions](https://github.com/tspr0tege/Codewars)

This is a repo where I store my solutions to the Codewars toy problems I've completed. Of particular note is the 3rd-kyu solution that was just me skipping ahead to the highest level of my cohort mates from Hack Reactor. The solution was efficient, and I'm happy to say I had one of the shortest solutions of any of the examples I saw, on Codewars.

### [Quest Log](https://github.com/tspr0tege/quest-log-old)

I'm currently in the process of reworking this project, and the latest repo is private (for now). I have linked to the repository of an old version. The idea is an app that will gamify productivity, following RPG models of character progression.

## üéì Education

## üíº Work Experience

### Freelance Work
06/2021 - present
I worked on a geolocation project with a startup, using serverless architecture via Netlify. My role was ultimately equivalent to tech lead, as the client deferred many decisions to me. Personally wrote their pathfinding algorithm to prioritize most proximal direction, and confirm no other shorter routes existed.

The other major project was a video aggregator website, using Wix. This involved learning the Wix editor, as well as their proprietary jQuery library and noSQL database to populate the information and website elements, as not everything the client requested was something the drag-and-drop editor was designed to handle.

### Andromeda 360
Aug 2022
I worked exclusively on the platform's front-end, addressing bugs, updating the UI, and implementing tests. Unfortunately a month after starting, the funding round did not succeed, and my position was eliminated. The experience remains invaluable, as the codebase and the people I worked with were amazing.
